# Spam Mail Classifier ðŸ“§

## Overview

This project is a machine learning model designed to classify emails as **"Spam"** or **"Ham"** (not spam). It uses a **Logistic Regression** algorithm combined with **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** vectorization to process and analyze the text content of the emails, achieving high accuracy in detecting unsolicited messages.

---

## Features

* Classifies SMS messages or emails into two categories: spam or ham.
* Utilizes TF-IDF to convert text data into a meaningful numerical representation.
* Implements a Logistic Regression model, which is efficient and interpretable.
* Includes data preprocessing steps to clean and prepare the text for modeling.

---

## Technologies Used

* **Python 3.x**
* **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning models (Logistic Regression) and text vectorization (TfidfVectorizer).
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and loading the dataset.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** For model development and experimentation.
* **[Optional: Matplotlib/Seaborn]**: For data visualization.

## Setup and Installation

To get the project running on your local machine, follow these steps.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[your-username]/[your-repository-name].git
    cd [your-repository-name]
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    * **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    * **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    *(First, make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt`)*
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## How to Use

1.  **Place your dataset** (e.g., `spam.csv`) in the root directory of the project.
2.  **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Spam_Classifier.ipynb
    ```
3.  Alternatively, if you have a Python script (`main.py`):
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Dataset

The model was trained on the **[Name of Your Dataset, e.g., SMS Spam Collection Dataset from Kaggle]**. The dataset contains `[Number]` messages labeled as either spam or ham.

## Model Performance ðŸ“Š

The trained Logistic Regression model achieved the following performance on the test set:

* **Accuracy:** `[e.g., 98%]`
* **Precision:** `[e.g., 97% for the spam class]`
* **Recall:** `[e.g., 95% for the spam class]`

For a detailed performance breakdown, please see the confusion matrix and classification report in the Jupyter Notebook.
